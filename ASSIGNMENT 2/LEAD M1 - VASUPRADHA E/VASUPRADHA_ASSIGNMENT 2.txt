ASSIGNMENT 2

Build a python code, Assume u get temperature and humidity values (generated with random functions to a variable) and write a condition to continuously detect alarm in case of high temperature. 

PYTHON CODE : 
import random
temp=random.uniform(10,50)
humidity=random.uniform(30,60)
print (‘Temperature =’, temp)
print (‘Humidity =’,humidity )
if(temp>38):
    print ('Temperature is high, Alarm detected')
else:
    print('Normal temperature') 

OUTPUT :
Temperature = 17.86
Humidity = 50.95
Normal temperature

Temperature = 42.84
Humidity = 30.45
Temperature is high, Alarm detected
